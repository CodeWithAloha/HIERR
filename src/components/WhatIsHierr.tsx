        At HIERR we aim to enable actions toward a more resilient, equitable,
        and sustainable economy. We want to learn from the economic impacts and
        experiences of hardship associated with the COVID-19 pandemic to inform
        and enable impactful actions. Rather than assume what these hardships
        were like, we are conducting a statewide study to learn from diverse
        stories told by residents and businesses across the state.
