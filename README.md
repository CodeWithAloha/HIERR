### Philosophy

The HIERR Project aims to enable actions toward a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable economy. This planning process is designed to learn from the economic impacts and experiences of hardship associated with the COVID-19 pandemic to inform and enable actions toward a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable economy. The HIERR Project will build on both the statewide and county-level goals and objectives for economic development and resilience identified in the Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy ([CEDS](https://planning.hawaii.gov/spb/ceds/)).

### Project Objectives

- Identifying gaps and strategies to mitigate Hawaii's economic vulnerabilities and hardships revealed during the COVID-19 pandemic;
- Compiling specific projects / programs that address the identified gaps;
- Aligning project / program needs to resources and enabling conditions necessary for implementation; and
- Advancing pre-disaster economic recovery planning across all hazards.
